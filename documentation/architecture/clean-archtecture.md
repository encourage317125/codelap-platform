## Enforce entity invariance at the DTO level vs. field level.

In the DDD forum clean architecture example (https://github.com/stemmlerjs/ddd-forum), we have the concept of composing an entity with its collection of fields. Each field is instantiated through a static helper method to ensure invariance.

We have a similar concept in (https://github.com/pvarentsov/typescript-clean-architecture), except the invariance is acted on the DTO level.

The DDD forum approach seems too verbose, pre-optimizing for different subset combinations of the entity's fields. Where in real life, not many variants of DTO's are used, we can just easily create a new use case DTO using class-validator.

## Ports & Adapters

Naming things with `Port` & `Adapter` is quite nice, as it lets us know that a complementary part exists.

CQRS works nicely with an Event Sourcing DDD-driven approach. Each command contains the event, which is complemented with a domain rich model that can hydrate our models.

## Where do DTO's belong

DTO isn't part of the domain core, but part of the application. It crosses boundary to the external.

## Use Case

Define the actions your actors can take

## Request vs Domain Validation

## Domain vs Application services

Domain services hold business logic, whereas application services call those logic

Application services are interactors & orchestrate calls to domain services

## EBI

Entity-Boundary-Interactor has the concept of actors that perform use cases via a boundary object. Interactors are the boundary object that orchestrate the interaction of use cases similar to application services.

## Use Case vs Application Service

An application service implements a use case. A use case has a port input & a DTO output.

The DTO's are based on use cases.

## Use Case Port/Adapter & controllers

A Use Case wraps around a port, controllers depend on the port interface. The controller is an adapter in that it fulfills the requirements of the port with input data.

We can also use Request instead of Port

## Package by Component

3 components

- Presentation
- Core
- Infrastructure

## Shared Adapter

Our TypeORM entities are kept outside the application core but accessible by all modules
